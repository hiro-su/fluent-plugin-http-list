{"tagline":"A plugin to accept a JSON list of events via HTTP Post.","name":"Fluent-plugin-http-list","google":"","body":"# fluent-plugin-http-list\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis plugin takes a JSON list of events as input via HTTP POST. If you're\r\nsending a lot of events this simplifies your client's code and eliminates \r\nthe overhead of creating a lot of brief connections.\r\n\r\nâ€» Note that unlike the default HTTP plugin, this does *not* support msgpack. \r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe HttpListInput plugin uses the same settings you would use for the standard\r\nHTTP input plugin. Example:\r\n\r\n    <source>\r\n      type http_list\r\n      port 8888\r\n      bind 0.0.0.0\r\n      body_size_limit 32m\r\n      keepalive_timeout 10s\r\n    </source>\r\n\r\nLike the HTTP input plugin, the tag is determined by the URL used, which means \r\nall events in one request must have the same tag.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nHave your logging system send JSON lists of events. Example:\r\n\r\n    curl -X POST -d 'json=[{\"fish\":\"catfish\",\"user\":23},{\"fish\":\"elephantfish\",\"user\":23}]' \\\r\n      http://localhost:8888/fish.tracker\r\n\r\nEach event will go to your output plugins as an individual event. \r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 M3, Inc. \r\n\r\nBased on the in_http plugin by FURUHASHI Sadayuki\r\n\r\nApache License, Version 2.0\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
